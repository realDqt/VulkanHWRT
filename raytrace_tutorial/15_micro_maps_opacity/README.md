# 15 Micro-Maps Opacity - Tutorial

![](/docs/images/15.png)

This tutorial demonstrates **Opacity Micro-Maps**, a Vulkan extension that enables efficient ray tracing with selective AnyHit shader invocation. Micro-maps provide hardware-accelerated triangle subdivision for fine-grained opacity control without the performance overhead of traditional geometry subdivision. The main learning objective is to understand how micro-maps can optimize ray-triangle intersection testing by encoding visibility information at the sub-triangle level.

## Key Changes from 02_basic.cpp

### 1. Shader Changes

#### Added: `rahit.slang` (AnyHit Shader)

- Introduces the AnyHit shader stage for selective ray acceptance/rejection
- Implements radius-based opacity testing to cut out circular regions from the plane
- Demonstrates how micro-maps can reduce AnyHit shader calls by pre-classifying triangle regions

```glsl
[shader("anyhit")]
void rahitMain(inout HitPayload payload, in BuiltInTriangleIntersectionAttributes attr)
{
    float3 pos = WorldRayOrigin() + WorldRayDirection() * RayTCurrent();
    
    // Cut out regions outside the radius
    if((pushConst.useAnyHit == 1) && (length(pos) > pushConst.radius))
    {
        IgnoreHit();
        return;
    }
    
    payload.color = float3(1.0F, 0.0F, 0.0F);  // Red tint to show AnyHit was called
    AcceptHitAndEndSearch();
}
```

### 2. C++ Application Changes

#### Modified: `15_micro_maps_opacity.cpp`

- Adds `MicromapProcess` class for managing micro-map creation and data
- Introduces `BirdCurveHelper` class for efficient triangle subdivision
- Extends acceleration structure creation to support micro-map attachment
- Adds UI controls for real-time parameter adjustment

#### New Class Members

```cpp
struct MicroMapsSettings {
    bool enableOpacity{true};
    int subdivLevel{3};
    float radius{0.5f};
    bool useAnyHit{true};
    uint16_t micromapFormat{VK_OPACITY_MICROMAP_FORMAT_4_STATE_EXT};
} m_mmSettings;

std::unique_ptr<MicromapProcess> m_micromapProcess;
```

### 3. Data Structure Changes

#### Modified: Push Constants

- Adds `radius` parameter for controlling opacity cutoff distance
- Adds `useAnyHit` flag for toggling AnyHit shader functionality
- Adds `numBaseTriangles` for wireframe visualization

#### New Buffer Types

- Micro-map value buffer storing opacity states per micro-triangle
- Micro-map triangle buffer with subdivision and format information
- Micro-map index buffer for triangle-to-micro-map mapping

### 4. Pipeline Changes

#### Modified: `createRayTracingPipeline()`

- Enables micro-map support with `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_RAY_TRACING_OPACITY_MICROMAP_BIT_EXT`
- Adds AnyHit shader group to the ray tracing pipeline
- Extends shader group count to accommodate the new shader stage

### 5. Acceleration Structure Changes

#### Modified: `createBottomLevelAS()`

- Attaches micro-map data to triangle geometry using `VkAccelerationStructureTrianglesOpacityMicromapEXT`
- Enables micro-map updates with `VK_BUILD_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_ALLOW_OPACITY_MICROMAP_UPDATE_EXT`
- Links micro-map buffers to acceleration structure geometry

## How It Works

### Micro-Map Concept

Opacity Micro-Maps encode visibility information for triangle sub-regions at a much finer granularity than traditional geometry. Instead of subdividing geometry into smaller triangles, micro-maps store per-micro-triangle opacity states that the ray tracing hardware uses to make intelligent decisions about ray-triangle intersections.

Each micro-triangle can be classified into three states:

- **Fully Opaque**: Rays always hit these regions (no AnyHit shader call needed)
- **Fully Transparent**: Rays ignore these regions completely (hardware automatically skips)
- **Unknown Transparent**: Requires AnyHit shader evaluation to determine visibility

### Bird Curve Subdivision

The Bird Curve algorithm provides an efficient way to subdivide triangles while maintaining spatial coherence. It converts micro-triangle indices to barycentric coordinates and interpolates vertex positions to determine each micro-triangle's location within the parent triangle.

### Triangle-Circle Intersection

The core algorithm determines micro-triangle opacity by testing intersection with a circular region during micro-map generation. This pre-computes which micro-triangles are inside, outside, or partially inside the opacity region, allowing the hardware to make fast intersection decisions.

## Benefits

### Selective AnyHit Shader Invocation

Traditional ray tracing with transparency requires the AnyHit shader to be called for every ray-triangle intersection. With micro-maps:

- **Fully Opaque regions**: No AnyHit shader call needed
- **Fully Transparent regions**: Ray automatically ignored  
- **Unknown regions**: AnyHit shader called only when necessary

### Memory Efficiency

Micro-maps provide fine-grained opacity control without the memory overhead of geometry subdivision:

- **Traditional subdivision**: 3 vertices per triangle × 4 bytes = 12 bytes per triangle
- **Micro-maps (level 3, 2-state)**: 64 micro-triangles × 1 bit = 8 bytes total

### Hardware Acceleration

Modern GPUs have dedicated hardware for micro-map processing, providing faster intersection testing, reduced memory bandwidth requirements, and better cache utilization for micro-map data.

## Technical Details

### Micro-Map Formats

**2-State Format**: 1 bit per micro-triangle (Opaque/Transparent) - 8 triangles per byte
**4-State Format**: 2 bits per micro-triangle (Opaque/Transparent/Unknown Transparent) - 4 triangles per byte

### Subdivision Levels

| Level | Micro-Triangles | Memory (2-state) | Memory (4-state) |
|-------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| 1     | 4              | 0.5 bytes        | 1 byte           |
| 2     | 16             | 2 bytes          | 4 bytes          |
| 3     | 64             | 8 bytes          | 16 bytes         |
| 4     | 256            | 32 bytes         | 64 bytes         |
| 5     | 1024           | 128 bytes        | 256 bytes        |

### UI Controls

The tutorial provides real-time controls for experimentation:

- **Enable Opacity**: Toggle micro-maps functionality
- **Subdivision Level**: Adjust micro-triangle detail (1-5)
- **Show Wireframe**: Visualize geometry structure  
- **Radius**: Control opacity cutoff distance (0.1-2.0)
- **Use AnyHit Shader**: Enable/disable any-hit processing
- **Micromap Format**: Switch between 2-state and 4-state formats

## Best Practices

### Format Selection

- **Use 2-state format** for simple binary opacity (e.g., cutouts, holes)
- **Use 4-state format** for complex patterns requiring AnyHit evaluation
- **Consider memory usage** when choosing subdivision levels

### Subdivision Level Guidelines

- **Level 1-2**: Simple patterns, low memory usage
- **Level 3**: Good balance of detail and performance (recommended)
- **Level 4-5**: High detail, increased memory usage

### AnyHit Shader Optimization

- **Keep logic simple** for optimal performance
- **Use early returns** when possible
- **Minimize texture lookups** and complex calculations
- **Consider using micro-maps** to avoid AnyHit calls entirely

## Limitations

### Hardware Requirements

- **VK_EXT_opacity_micromap extension** support required
- **Hardware with micro-map acceleration** recommended
- **Driver support** for micro-map operations

### Memory Overhead

- **Additional buffers** for micro-map data
- **Increased memory usage** with higher subdivision levels
- **Buffer alignment requirements** for micro-map data

### Complexity

- **More complex setup** than basic ray tracing
- **Additional shader stages** (AnyHit shader)
- **Micro-map data management** required
