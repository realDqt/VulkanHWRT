# 03 Any Hit - Tutorial

![Any Hit Shader Tutorial Screenshot](/docs/images/03.png)

This tutorial introduces any-hit shaders, a powerful ray tracing feature that enables transparency effects, alpha testing, and procedural cutouts. Any-hit shaders execute for every intersection during ray traversal, allowing selective hit rejection to create transparent materials without complex geometry.

**Learning Objective**: Understand how any-hit shaders work and implement transparency effects using the `IgnoreHit()` function.

## Key Changes from 02_basic.cpp

### 1. Shader Changes

**Modified: `shaders/rtanyhit.slang`**

- Added new any-hit shader stage to the ray tracing pipeline
- Implemented `anyhitMain()` function that uses `IgnoreHit()` to create transparency effects
- Created procedural patterns using position-based logic

```hlsl
[shader("anyhit")]
void anyhitMain(inout HitPayload payload, in BuiltInTriangleIntersectionAttributes attr)
{
  float3 pos = WorldRayOrigin() + WorldRayDirection() * RayTCurrent();
  
  // Circular cutout - core concept
  if(length(pos) > pushConst.radius)
  {
    IgnoreHit();  // Let ray pass through
    return;
  }
}
```

### 2. C++ Application Changes

**Modified: `03_any_hit.cpp`**

- Added `eAnyHit` stage to the shader pipeline enum
- Attached any-hit shader to the triangles hit group
- Removed `VK_GEOMETRY_OPAQUE_BIT_KHR` flag to enable any-hit shader execution

```cpp
enum StageIndices
{
  eRaygen,
  eMiss,
  eClosestHit,
  eAnyHit,        // New any-hit shader stage
  eShaderGroupCount
};

// Attach any-hit shader to hit group
group.anyHitShader = eAnyHit;  // Enable any-hit shader
```

**Key Change in `primitiveToGeometry()`**:

```cpp
.flags = VK_GEOMETRY_NO_DUPLICATE_ANY_HIT_INVOCATION_BIT_KHR, // Removed OPAQUE flag
```

### 3. Data Structure Changes

#### Modified: Push Constants

- Added `radius` parameter to control the circular cutout size
- Added `opacity` parameter for transparency effects
- Added `transparencyMode` to switch between different transparency techniques

```cpp
struct TutoPushConstant
{
  // ... existing members ...
  float radius = 1.0f;              // Circular cutout radius
  float opacity = 0.5f;             // Transparency level (0=transparent, 1=opaque)
  int   transparencyMode = 0;       // 0=cutout, 1=stochastic, 2=accumulative
};
```

### 4. UI Changes

**Modified: `onUIRender()`**

- Added slider control to adjust the cutout radius interactively
- Added transparency controls for opacity and mode selection

```cpp
        ImGui::SeparatorText("AnyHit");
        ImGui::SliderFloat("Radius", &m_pushValues.radius, 0.01f, 5.0f);
        
        ImGui::SeparatorText("Transparency");
        ImGui::SliderFloat("Opacity", &m_pushValues.opacity, 0.0f, 1.0f);
        const char* transparencyModes[] = {"Cutout Only", "Stochastic", "Accumulative"};
        ImGui::Combo("Mode", &m_pushValues.transparencyMode, transparencyModes, 3);
```

## How It Works

Any-hit shaders are called for **every** intersection during ray traversal, unlike closest-hit shaders which only execute for the nearest intersection. This enables powerful transparency and alpha testing effects by selectively ignoring intersections.

**Key Mechanism**: The `IgnoreHit()` function tells the ray tracer to discard the current intersection and continue traversal, allowing rays to "pass through" certain geometry.

**Execution Order**:

1. Ray intersects with geometry
2. Any-hit shader executes (if present)
3. If `IgnoreHit()` is called, intersection is discarded and traversal continues
4. If no `IgnoreHit()`, closest-hit shader executes for the intersection

## Benefits

- **Transparency Effects**: Create transparent materials without complex geometry
- **Alpha Testing**: Implement texture-based transparency for foliage, fences, and other complex surfaces
- **Procedural Cutouts**: Generate complex patterns and shapes programmatically
- **Performance**: More efficient than using actual transparent geometry in some cases

## Technical Details

### Performance Considerations

- **Frequent Execution**: Any-hit shaders run for every intersection, so keep them lightweight
- **Branch Divergence**: Complex logic can cause performance issues on GPU
- **Geometry Flags**: Use `VK_GEOMETRY_NO_DUPLICATE_ANY_HIT_INVOCATION_BIT_KHR` to avoid duplicate calls

### Common Use Cases

- **Alpha Testing**: Discard intersections based on texture alpha values
- **Procedural Transparency**: Create patterns, cutouts, and complex shapes
- **Shadow Optimization**: Skip certain intersections for shadow rays
- **Custom Intersection Logic**: Implement specialized intersection behavior

## Usage Instructions

### Interactive Controls

- **Radius Slider**: Adjust the circular cutout size from 0.01 to 5.0 units
- **Opacity Slider**: Control transparency level (0.0 = fully transparent, 1.0 = fully opaque)
- **Mode Selection**: Choose between different transparency techniques

### Expected Behavior

- **Cutout Only**: Binary transparency with circular cutout and checkerboard pattern
- **Stochastic**: Random sampling-based transparency with noise
- **Accumulative**: Proper transparency with color accumulation

## Advanced Transparency Techniques

The tutorial implements three transparency modes to demonstrate different approaches:

### Mode 0: Cutout Transparency

- **Concept**: Binary transparency using `IgnoreHit()` for complete cutouts
- **Use Case**: Fences, foliage, architectural elements
- **Performance**: Fastest, no color accumulation needed

### Mode 1: Stochastic Transparency

- **Concept**: Random sampling based on opacity value
- **Use Case**: Real-time transparency with acceptable noise
- **Performance**: Fast but requires temporal accumulation for quality

### Mode 2: Accumulative Transparency

- **Concept**: Color accumulation through transparent surfaces
- **Use Case**: Glass, water, simple transparency
- **Performance**: More expensive but simple

### Key Implementation Concepts

**Stochastic Transparency**: Uses high-quality pseudo-random number generation (xxhash32 + PCG) based on pixel coordinates and frame number to decide whether to ignore hits. The frame number is incremented in `onRender()` to ensure proper temporal variation for accumulation effects.

**Accumulative Transparency**: Modifies the ray payload to accumulate color contributions and reduce ray weight as it passes through transparent surfaces.

**Alpha Testing**: Can be extended to sample texture alpha values and use them for transparency decisions.

### Performance Trade-offs

- **Cutout**: Fastest, binary decisions only
- **Stochastic**: Fast but noisy, requires temporal filtering (see 04_jitter_camera)
- **Accumulative**: Most accurate but requires careful payload management

## Implementation Details

### Critical Setup Requirements

1. **Geometry Flags**: Must remove `VK_GEOMETRY_OPAQUE_BIT_KHR` from acceleration structure geometry to enable any-hit shader execution
2. **Shader Binding**: Any-hit shader must be attached to the hit group in the ray tracing pipeline

### Common Pitfalls

- **Missing Geometry Flag**: Any-hit shaders won't execute if geometry is marked as opaque
- **Heavy Any-Hit Logic**: Keep any-hit shaders lightweight as they execute frequently

## Next Steps

This any-hit implementation can be extended with:

- **[04_jitter_camera](../04_jitter_camera)** - Add temporal anti-aliasing to reduce noise
- **[05_shadow_miss](../05_shadow_miss)** - Optimize shadow rays with any-hit shaders
- **[06_reflection](../06_reflection)** - Combine with reflection rays for complex materials
- **[13_callable_shader](../13_callable_shader)** - Use callable shaders for complex any-hit logic
