# 13 Callable Shaders - Tutorial

![](/docs/images/13.png)

This tutorial demonstrates how to use callable shaders to create a modular material system with procedural textures. Callable shaders enable you to break complex shading logic into reusable, specialized functions that can be invoked dynamically during ray tracing, eliminating expensive branching in closest hit shaders.

## Key Changes from 02_basic.cpp

### 1. Shader Changes

**Modified: `13_callable_shader.slang`**

- Added callable shader functions for different material types (diffuse, plastic, glass, constant)
- Added procedural texture callable shaders (noise, checker, voronoi)
- Modified closest hit shader to use `CallShader` instead of branching logic

```hlsl
[shader("callable")]
void material_diffuse_main(inout CallablePayload payload)
{
  // Simple Lambertian lighting - no reflection
  payload.weight = 0.0;
  float dotNL = max(dot(payload.worldNormal, payload.lightDir), 0.0);
  payload.color *= dotNL * payload.lightColor;
}

// In closest hit shader:
int materialType = InstanceID();  // Direct material lookup
CallShader<CallablePayload>(materialType, callablePayload);
```

### 2. C++ Application Changes

**Modified: `13_callable_shader.cpp`**

- Extended `StageIndices` enum to include callable shader stages
- Added callable shader groups to pipeline creation
- Modified TLAS creation to use material types in `instanceCustomIndex`
- Added material assignment UI controls

```cpp
enum StageIndices
{
  eRaygen, eMiss, eClosestHit,
  // Material callable shaders
  eMaterialDiffuse, eMaterialPlastic, eMaterialGlass, eMaterialConstant,
  // Texture callable shaders  
  eTextureNoise, eTextureChecker, eTextureVoronoi,
  eShaderGroupCount
};

// TLAS creation uses material type instead of mesh index
ray_inst.instanceCustomIndex = m_objectMaterials[i];
```

### 3. Data Structure Changes

#### Modified: Push constants and payload structures

- Added `TextureType` enum for procedural texture selection
- Created separate payload structures for material and texture callable shaders
- Added material assignment arrays for per-object material types

```hlsl
struct CallablePayload
{
  float3 color, worldPos, worldNormal, viewDir, lightDir, lightColor;
  RayDesc ray;
  float weight;
};

struct TextureCallablePayload
{
  float3 color;
  float2 uv;
};
```

### 4. UI Changes

**Modified: `onUIRender()`**

- Added material type selection for each object (requires TLAS recreation)
- Added texture type selection (push constant, no TLAS recreation needed)
- Added animation speed control for procedural textures

## How It Works

Callable shaders work by extending the ray tracing pipeline with additional shader stages that can be invoked dynamically. Instead of using complex branching logic in the closest hit shader to handle different materials, each material is implemented as a separate callable shader function.

The key insight is using the `instanceCustomIndex` field in the TLAS to store material types directly. When a ray hits an object, `InstanceID()` returns this material type, allowing direct dispatch to the appropriate callable shader without any conditional logic.

## Benefits

### Performance Advantages

- **Eliminates branching**: Material selection happens at the TLAS level, not in shader code
- **Better GPU utilization**: Each material gets its own specialized shader
- **Reduced compilation time**: No complex branching logic to compile

### Code Organization

- **Modularity**: Each material is a separate, reusable function
- **Maintainability**: Easy to add new materials without modifying existing code
- **Debugging**: Individual materials can be tested and debugged in isolation

### Flexibility

- **Runtime material selection**: Materials can be changed without recompiling shaders
- **Different payload types**: Material and texture callable shaders can use different data structures
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new material types or procedural textures

## Technical Details

### Material Types

The tutorial implements four different material types as callable shaders:

- **Diffuse**: Simple Lambertian lighting with no reflection
- **Plastic**: Metallic material with reflections using PBR model
- **Glass**: Transparent material with refraction and Fresnel effects
- **Constant**: Emissive material that emits light

### Procedural Textures

Three procedural texture types are implemented:

- **Noise**: Animated polka dot pattern with wave distortion
- **Checker**: Static checkerboard pattern
- **Voronoi**: Animated cell pattern with time-based generation

### Performance Considerations

**Material Changes**: Require TLAS recreation because `instanceCustomIndex` is part of the acceleration structure. This is expensive but necessary for proper material assignment.

**Texture Changes**: Use push constants and don't require TLAS recreation, making them much faster to modify at runtime.

### Limitations

- Callable shaders cannot call other callable shaders or trace rays
- Additional SBT complexity and memory overhead
- More complex pipeline setup compared to basic ray tracing

## Usage Instructions

### Interactive Controls

- **Material Type**: Select material for each object (requires TLAS rebuild)
- **Texture Type**: Choose procedural texture (instant, no rebuild needed)
- **Animation Speed**: Control texture animation speed

### Expected Behavior

- Different objects should display different materials based on selection
- Procedural textures should animate smoothly when enabled
- Material changes should trigger a brief pause while TLAS rebuilds
- Texture changes should be immediate with no performance impact
